/**
 * The graph package provides the basic interfaces for graphs in the COGA Graph
 * Library. It provides types for both, directed and undirected graphs and
 * several different implementations.
 * 
 * <p>Implementations differ on several details, such as the type of storage
 * (e.g. adjacency list vs. matrix) or the possibility to change a graph later.
