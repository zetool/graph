# CHANGELOG

## [Unreleased]

### Features
- Convert Dijkstra class to algorithm
- Implemented instance and solution types for shortest paths
- Updated integral Dijkstra to work with directed and undirected graphs
- Added Kruskal's and Prim's or Jarn√≠k's algorithm, taken from zet
- Added minimum Steiner tree 2-approximation algorithm, adapted from zet

### Security
- Bumped xstrem from 1.4.6 to 1.4.10

## [0.2.0]

### Features
- Introduced new interfaces for mutable graphs

### Bugfix
- Made `DefaultGraph` undirected
- Fixed constructors not to excpect ordered, non-successive node ids

## [0.1.0]

### Features
- Interfaces for graph data structures: `Graph`, specializations `DirectedGraph` and `UndirectedGraph`
- Mutable implementations for the graph interfaces, special implementations like outgoing star
- Algorithms: Graph search, `Dijkstra` (integral and rational), Moore-Bellman-Ford
- Supporting data structures for visualization
